            <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The best time to visit is between March and April and September to October.</li>
                <li> Rishikesh is best avoided during the monsoon months from July to August, as it receives heavy
                    rainfall. Rafting is also closed during this time.</li>
                <li>Winter, from November until February, is cold but generally pleasant. So, bring woolens. </li>
                <li>
                    Those interested in yoga shouldn't miss the International Yoga Festival, held in Rishikesh in March
                    each year. </li>
                <li> Don't forget to attend Parmarth Niketan ashram (in the Swag Ashram area) to experience the Ganga
                    Aarti (worship ritual with fire) every evening.</li>
